# On Window 10 I experienced problems acquiring video when ffmpeg was launched
# from wwol_rec_act script, being launched from command line i.e. like 
#     python wwol_rec_act.py
# Same problems with the frozen version of this. So donâ€™t use this script.
# Launching interpreter, writing 'import...' manually and so on, and so for
# worked fine.
